This is a library and a GUI control program written in Python for
controlling a Waters 2700 Sample Manager (and compatible) liquid
handling robot. These are quite common in Mass spectrometry labs and
typically have 1-2 arms with attached syringes and one 6-port valve.

The library allows to easily 

  *  control the movements of up to 2 arms
  *  control the syringe pump and 6-port valve to dispense and draw
     liquids from a reservoir or e.g. a 96-well plate
  *  save and recall positions (like "wash", "A1" on a plate, etc.) for
     easier scripting

The GUI program provides a platform-independent graphical interface
for the library. However, the library can be used without the GUI
part. For a description of the serial command protocol, have a look

<h1>Downloads</h1>

The source code and binary installers for Windows can be downloaded
from [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/py-liquidhandler/|here].

<h1>Installation</h1>

Prerequisites: You will need the [http://www.python.org|Python
interpreter] and the following Python modules:

  *  [http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/|py-serial]
  *  [http://pyyaml.org/|py-yaml]

And additionally for the GUI part

  *  [www.wxpython.org|wxPython]

After having these installed, run the binary installer (for Windows)
or run "sudo python setup.py install" from the commandline on Unix.

<h1>Using the library</h1>

A typical usage pattern would be

<verbatim>
import liquidhandler

r=liquidhandler.Robot()
r.Move([100,100,50])
r.AddPosition('wash')

r.Move([1000,100,50])
r.AddPosition('sample')

r.Goto('sample')
r.Draw(100,'sample')
r.Goto('wash')
r.Dispense(100)
</verbatim>

<h1>Using the GUI</h1>

Just start the "Liquidator" script.
